# MatrixDriver
A driver for 64x32 HUB75 LED matrices.

A repository to explore how LED matrices work.

Example code can be seen in `main.cpp`, bitmaps can be converted to arrays using the python script in the `./bmp` folder.

Made specifically for the Adafruit MatrixPortal M4, but you can adapt the code to work for other MCUs as well, see `Defines.h`.

Lots of information about LED matrices came from [this](https://www.sparkfun.com/news/2650) sparkfun article.
